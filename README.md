## Selected Theme: Food Security

## Title of the Project: Virus X, Virus Y, and Virus S detection based on potato plant leaf

## Executive Summary
One of the major hindrances for farmers are unavailability of new, up-to-date agriscience. As Indonesia faces an agriculture crisis where there are less farmers available, more fast and reliable resources need to be provided for them to maintain productivity, including ways to deal with pest and plant disease. With our app, we can help farmers identify the disease on their plants and proper ways to deal with it, saving lots of crucial time, money, and energy with only a smartphone and stable internet connection. 

## Implementation
1. Machine Learning: Building models with TensorFlow lite, using data pipelines to serve the models, and preprocessing the data using data augmentation.
2. Android: Applying ML data to develop a ‘light’ app that could run with little memory space to ensure smooth running even on older versions of Android models.
3. Cloud Computing: Creating AI Platform to train, test, and predict for ML, creating App Engine for deploy the Android App, creating and managing Cloud Storage Bucket, creating simple dashboard  monitoring and alerting
